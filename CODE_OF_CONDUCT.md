### **Code of Professional Conduct**

#### **1. Our Pledge**

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to maintain a professional and harassment-free environment for everyone, regardless of personal characteristics. We judge contributions and ideas based on their technical merit and quality.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, productive, and healthy community.

#### **2. Our Standards**

**Examples of behavior that contributes to a productive environment:**

* Maintaining a professional and respectful tone, even during technical disagreements.
* Focusing on the topic at hand (code, architecture, tasks), rather than on individuals.
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive, evidence-based criticism.
* Accepting responsibility for our mistakes and learning from the experience.
* Focusing on what is best for the overall project.

**Examples of unacceptable behavior:**

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and any form of sexual attention or advances.
* Trolling, direct insults, ad hominem attacks, and political attacks unrelated to the project.
* Public or private harassment.
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission.
* Any other conduct that clearly hinders professional and collaborative work on the project.

**Important Clarification:** Sharp, but on-topic, technical criticism of code, architecture, or a proposed solution is **not** considered an insult or a personal attack. The goal is a high-quality project, and professional debates are an integral part of achieving it.

#### **3. Enforcement Responsibilities**

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take fair and appropriate corrective action in response to any behavior they deem destructive to the project.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct. Reasons for moderation decisions will be communicated when appropriate and without violating the privacy of other participants.

#### **4. Scope**

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces (repositories, issue trackers, chats, etc.) and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.

#### **5. Reporting**

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at [Alexey Nis](mailto:delexzone@gmail.com). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

Community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy of the reporter of any incident.

#### **6. Enforcement Guidelines**

Community leaders will follow these guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

**1. Correction**
* **Violation:** An isolated incident of unprofessional language, ad hominem attacks, or other behavior identified as a violation of these standards.
* **Consequence:** A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation. A public apology may be requested.

**2. Warning**
* **Violation:** A repeat offense after a correction has been issued, or a single serious incident.
* **Consequence:** A warning with consequences for continued disruptive behavior. No interaction with the people involved for a specified period of time. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

**3. Temporary Ban**
* **Violation:** A serious violation of community standards, including sustained disruptive behavior.
* **Consequence:** A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

**4. Permanent Ban**
* **Violation:** A demonstrated pattern of violating standards, including harassment of an individual, aggression, or targeted subversive activity within the community.
